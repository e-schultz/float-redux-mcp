# GitHub Issues for Float Redux MCP

Create these issues when you set up the GitHub repository:

## High Priority Issues

### 1. Enhanced Natural Language Middleware Compilation
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `middleware`, `nlp`

**Description:**
Improve the natural language → Redux middleware compilation system with better pattern recognition and more sophisticated Ollama integration.

**Current State:**
- Basic regex patterns for simple cases
- Ollama fallback for complex language
- Limited pattern library

**Goals:**
- Expand regex pattern library for common AI workflows
- Add context-aware compilation (learn from user patterns)
- Support multi-step workflow descriptions
- Add validation and testing for generated middleware

**Example:**
```javascript
// Should parse complex workflows like:
"When users ask about React, first search the vault for react-patterns, 
then load the context, boost brain focus, and if no results found, 
search the web and update the vault with new findings"
```

### 2. Obsidian MCP Integration
**Labels:** `integration`, `obsidian`, `vault`

**Description:**
Integrate with Obsidian MCP to enable vault operations through Redux actions.

**Goals:**
- Connect to Obsidian MCP server
- Add vault slice with file operations
- Support note creation from bridge restorations
- Enable knowledge graph updates via middleware

**Actions to implement:**
- `vault/search` → `obsidian_search_vault`
- `vault/create_note` → `obsidian_create_file`
- `vault/update_note` → `obsidian_update_file`

### 3. Linear MCP Integration for Issue Tracking
**Labels:** `integration`, `linear`, `issues`

**Description:**
Connect to Linear MCP for automatic issue creation and tracking from AI workflows.

**Example workflows:**
- Bridge creation automatically creates Linear issues for follow-up
- Failed middleware execution creates bug reports
- Context loading triggers project updates

## Medium Priority Issues

### 4. Performance Optimization
**Labels:** `performance`, `optimization`

**Description:**
Optimize MCP connection handling and reduce latency for common operations.

**Areas:**
- Connection pooling for MCP clients
- Caching for frequent Chroma queries
- Ollama request batching
- Redux state persistence

### 5. Error Recovery and Resilience
**Labels:** `reliability`, `error-handling`

**Description:**
Improve error handling and recovery mechanisms for robust production use.

**Features:**
- Automatic retry logic for failed MCP calls
- Circuit breaker pattern for unstable connections
- Graceful degradation strategies
- Error reporting and alerting

### 6. Multi-User State Management
**Labels:** `enhancement`, `multi-user`

**Description:**
Support multiple user contexts and session isolation within the Redux store.

**Requirements:**
- User-scoped state slices
- Session management middleware
- Cross-user bridge sharing controls

## Low Priority Issues

### 7. Web UI for State Visualization
**Labels:** `ui`, `visualization`, `nice-to-have`

**Description:**
Create a web interface for real-time Redux state visualization and middleware debugging.

**Features:**
- Live state tree view
- Action replay and debugging
- Middleware execution timeline
- Performance metrics dashboard

### 8. Plugin System for Custom Middleware
**Labels:** `architecture`, `extensibility`

**Description:**
Create a plugin system allowing third-party middleware compilers and custom workflow patterns.

### 9. Metrics and Analytics
**Labels:** `analytics`, `monitoring`

**Description:**
Add comprehensive metrics collection for usage patterns, performance monitoring, and system health.

### 10. Documentation Website
**Labels:** `documentation`, `website`

**Description:**
Create a dedicated documentation website with interactive examples and tutorials.
